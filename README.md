# Machine Learning 2025 - Self Study Notes  

## üìñ Introduction  
This repository contains my self-study notes on **Machine Learning**, covering fundamental concepts, theoretical explanations, and practical applications.  

I am learning under the guidance of **Dr. Loi** (*luu.p.loi@googlemail.com*), who generously provides this course **free of charge**. This repository serves as both a structured summary and a personal learning log, which I will continuously update.
